          <p>I am a mother of eleven and eight year old boys, born and bred in Eldoret town. I just joined the IT team as  customer channels solution analyst at Safaricom plc, after working as a customer care executive for about ten years. Though I have a business background, I have always had an eye for IT.  Everything about IT fascinates me, that is why I never stopped applying for jobs in the IT department. When I finally joined the team,  I knew I needed to get my hands on some skills that can be interesting.  When this opportunity presented itself, I knew this is it!</p>
